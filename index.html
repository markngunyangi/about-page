        <h2 class="h2-about">A little History About Me
        </h2>
   <p class="p-about">I’ve been helping busy/stressed students complete their assignments for close to 8 years now. I started doing it as a full-time job about 3 years ago. Having noticed how college students go through so much stress after worked directly with a couple of them, I share advice on; how to plan and always be on top of your schoolwork including how, with little to no experience, you can tackle assignments in such a short time, and improve your grades/GPA, and much more how to make your college life easier. Go through the site, grab anything useful you can find, and let me know how it’s helped you, or if I need to make any changes.</p>

      <div class="i-share">
          <h3>I share</h3>
          <p>Most of my quality material FREE, and give quality insights, advice, step by step instructions to help make your life as a student easier. For this, I lose thousands of dollars every month, since it’s valuable information I could sell on Amazon, and as a course, but why not invest in you anyway? Why not give, where everybody is busy trying to take away?</p>

      </div>
      <div class="write-assignmet">
          <h3>I write assignments/essays</h3>
          <p class="p-iwillnot">For a select few, handpicked number of clients. Even after giving away valuable free content, with step by step instructions to; improve your GPA, get better grades, be a better writer, be in control of your school life and showing my student clients how to do assignments, some students still ask me to write their papers for them. I help with that</p>

      </div>
      <div class="I-will-not">
<h3>I will not</h3>
<p class="p-iwillnot">Compromise the quality of my work, neither will I pretend to be a big company with hundreds/thousands of writers ready to take huge customer orders. I prefer, and I can only work with a few number of clients who appreciate and revere my work. They make great friends along the way, with whom we share great memories, and they happily send me other clients.</p>

       <h2 class="h2-part3">This is not a typical essay writing service.</h2>
       <div class="The-looks">
           <h3>The looks ...</h3>
           <p>
            Take a look at most essay writing services, and I will tell you what to expect. A flashy captivating headline, with a calculator to know how much assignments will cost you, and testimonials, many of which usually are not true, and some metric figures saying something like, “98% customer satisfaction, 152,936 completed orders, over 3578 skilled writers” etc.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="The-market">
           <h3>The market ...</h3>
           <p>
            You probably noticed, I have no name to imply I am a big company, with a huge team because I am not. I can’t handle many orders. My experience in the last years has made me value my sleeping time, relationships, family time, my life and my credibility, by not taking on large orders and working myself off. I also don’t advertise prices upon landing at the site. Why? You may ask. First, because I don’t serve a huge market. I only have a few slots available at a given time. Normally, I would lose about 25%-45% chance of converting more people, but that is not my aim. I could do web optimization techniques to increase leads and do what the SEO experts out there recommend, so as to get more customers. That is not my aim either. I could have also created my practical books into a simple online course and sold it for as little as $50 each, and with the right marketing, most people would buy. That isn’t my aim either</p>
       </div>
       <div class="The-priorities">
           <h3>The priorities ...</h3>
           <p>
            I prioritize most of my previous clients, and work with them since we have come a long way. I also prioritize referrals as they are usually like my other clients. To those students who may think my prices are high, I understand. I have already invested in you by creating guides for you, and I would also tell you, I am way cheaper than most sites out there.

       <div class="Therefore">
           <h3>Therefore, no more worries</h3>
           <p>
        I don’t think I have been selfish to leave anybody out. I think I did you a great service in putting up this site, but at least find a way to benefit directly. Share links with friends, colleagues and fellow students, and let people all benefit.</p>

        <h2  class="h2-part3">Why I Started This Site</h2>
        <div class="What-wrong">
 <h3>What's wrong with the current system ?</h3>
 <p>Most people have not learned how much the world would be better with a little bit of generosity and kindness. Everybody is trying to take a piece of the cake for themselves. Writing companies have hired expert designers and content creators, and they know what to write, to get you enticed so that they have your business. As a result, they position themselves, with numbers and testimonials, as companies that can do a great job for you, and they charge you for it, and then, it ends there. How you afford the high prices is all up to you. No writing company is asking themselves, “With such high prices, how will these students manage to pay for a whole semester’s number of assignments?” Also, there is somewhat, a kind of a trap with such services, because, once they start writing your paper professionally, you have to keep presenting such quality of papers the whole semester, otherwise, you risk getting caught for academic cheating; how frustrating. Wouldn’t you honestly like a change? Don’t you look forward to someone guiding you through the process?</p>
 </div> 
 <div class="What-distinguishes">
          <h3>What distinguishes me from the rest ?</h3>
 <p>Having been a writer for almost 8 years now, I don’t accuse these writing companies so much, because I was just like them; trying to get more work, more clients and more money. I didn’t quite care about how my clients would afford the prices. The human side of me has now taken me back, and I need to be a contributor, not a diminisher. When it comes to writing essays, I know what the professor looks for, and I know how to get it well-structured in a paper, for my clients. I have written a whole guide for that.
